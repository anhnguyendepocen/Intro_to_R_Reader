Look at this scatterplot:
```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- tibble(x = c(1:20),
        y = rnorm(20),
        z = rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), 5))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(text = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "null")
```

Hopefully we can already tell that this isn't a great graph. The complete lack of text means we have no idea what data are being visualized, or what we're
