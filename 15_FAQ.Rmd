# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are the answers to some assorted questions I've been asked, which are either not common, important, or interesting enough to put in the main text of the reader.

## Why is my code broken?
* Are all your parentheses in the right places?
* Do you have commas where you should?
* How's your capitalization?
* Did you load the package you're trying to use?
* If none of these fix your problem, try googling the error message R gives you. There's usually a good StackOverflow question on whatever you're trying to accomplish.

## Why is (_X_ package) named that?

* `ggplot` refers to the _**G**rammar of **G**raphics_, used to _plot_ things in a consistent manner
