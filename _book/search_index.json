Much of this course outline draws from Hadley Wickham’s 2012 stat405 class, as well as his wonderful textbooks R for Data Science (with Garrett Grolemund) and Advanced R. I’ve updated some elements, distilled others, and not kept much of the content, but the ideas and steering come very directly from those works. The class is budgeted as a thirteen week course composed of thirty-nine lectures. There are five assignments and zero exams. "],

Conventions of the course (and this reader) Things You’ll Need Introduction to RStudio", " 1 Introduction to R Welcome to the course! Over the next semester, we’ll be doing What is R? R is a programming language used most commonly for data analysis and science. It’s completely free and is adaptable to almost any project - for instance, this book, my website, and plenty of statistical softwares are all written in R. Once you know how to code in R, learning about and implementing those different adaptations is a piece of cake. The purpose of this class is to get you up to speed with the coding! What is coding? Coding is giving very specific instructions to a very stupid machine. Or rather, a very literal machine - if you do things out of order, or misspell something, or capitalize things you shouldn’t, the computer won’t do it - instead, it’ll give you an error message. But if you get the syntax exactly right, the computer can do very complex tasks very quickly. If that sounds frustrating, well… it sometimes is! But getting good at coding is mostly learning to be okay with being frustrated - and learning what to do when your code is being frustrated. For this class, remember that you can always email me - mike.mahoney.218@gmail.com - or swing by office hours for help with your code. We’ll go over strategies to fix your code outside of this class later on in the semester. Conventions of the course (and this reader) We’ll go over standard code styles a bit later in the course - there is a Right Waytm to code, but we won’t worry about that for a few more weeks. But so you can understand a few basics, here’s a few styles we’ll use in the text: If text is preformatted, it means it’s something from R - a function, some data, or anything else that you’d use in your code. Blocks of code will be represented as follows: print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) This format both makes it obvious that this is code - not text - and lets you copy and paste it into your R session to see the results for yourself. Code outputs, meanwhile, will mostly be shown like this: ## [1] &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Where text is commented out (that is, has a # in front, so R won’t parse it), so it won’t do anything if you put it in your session. There are some exceptions to these general rules, but this is enough to get us started. With the introductions out of the way, we can start getting you set up to coding R. Things You’ll Need There are several pieces of software integral to this course reader, namely: R download it here RStudio download it here Choose the free desktop version - you don’t need the server software, and you don’t need the commercial license. GitHub Desktop download it here You don’t need this until later in the course - and if you’re not actually enrolled in the course, you’ll technically never need it. You’ll be better off for knowing it, and it’ll make your life better - but you can get away without it. We’ll be installing other pieces of software (in the form of R packages) throughout this reader, but each of those will be explicitly labeled when we use them. Introduction to RStudio You’ll almost never need to use R directly in this course - the form of R that you download from that first link is much harder to use than anything professionals interact with. Most practitioners use what’s known as an IDE - an Interactive Development Environment. There’s a lot of choices of IDEs for R, but RStudio is the best one. Other textbooks would give you a more measured, even-handed approach to this issue. RStudio is the best one, though. This course is assuming you’re using RStudio for all the examples, questions, and assignments. As such, we’re going to go over what you’ll see when you open RStudio for the first time. On the bottom right there you’ll see a list of all the files available in the folder that you’re working in. This window will also show you graphs when you make them, and help files when you look for them. Above it is a list of everything that’s available in the current “environment” - that is, all the datasets/functions/code that you’ve already programmed in the session, that can be used again moving forward. On the left - taking up the full height of the pane - is something called the “Console”. This is the first place you can write R code, where you can give very specific commands to that very dumb machine. Try it now! Type the following into the console: print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) What happened? If you did it right, you should have gotten the following: ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; It’s cool, right? In addition to saying the things you tell it, you can use the R console to do math: 2 + 4 / 2 ## [1] 4 6^7 ## [1] 279936 18%%7 ## [1] 4 Note that R generally follows PEMDAS - we’ll go over that later. Also, %% is an operator (in the same way that +, *, -, / are all operators - mathematical symbols that represent a function) which returns the remainder - the integer (whole number) which remains after you’ve divided as much as you can. So while 7 fits into 18 twice (7*2 = 14), it leaves 4 “left over” afterwards. R can also do a lot of more complicated things. By putting a list of values inside c(), you create what’s known as a vector - a list of objects that R can interact with. c(1,2,3) ## [1] 1 2 3 c(18, &quot;ESF&quot;, 98) ## [1] &quot;18&quot; &quot;ESF&quot; &quot;98&quot; c(&quot;ESF&quot;, &quot;Acorns&quot;, &quot;Stumpies&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ESF&quot; &quot;Acorns&quot; &quot;Stumpies&quot; Look at the difference between that first and that second output - see how the numbers are in quotes the second time around? While R is capable of holding a lot of different types of data, a single vector isn’t. A vector has to either be a numeric or a character vector - it’s either numbers or symbols. This matters, because you can’t do math with symbols. For instance, if we try to divide the first vector by 3: c(1,2,3) / 3 ## [1] 0.3333333 0.6666667 1.0000000 It works just fine. But trying to divide our second vector: c(18, &quot;ESF&quot;, 98) / 3 Error in c(18, &quot;ESF&quot;, 98)/3 : non-numeric argument to binary operator Gives us our first error message of the course. I should mention that I lied a little bit - vectors can also be a third type, logical. If a vector is made up of TRUE and FALSE elements - and no other elements - then the vector is considered logical. Logical values are exactly what they sound like - they return TRUE if something is true, and FALSE if not. For instance: 6 &gt; 4 ## [1] TRUE 4 &gt; 6 ## [1] FALSE But again, vectors can only hold one type of data - a vector with a value of TRUE and a value of ESF will become a character vector. If you need to hold more than one type of data, you need a table - or, as they’re called in R, a dataframe. It is possible to make dataframes by hand in R: data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), z = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)) ## x y z ## 1 1 a TRUE ## 2 2 b TRUE ## 3 3 c FALSE However, this is rare - most of the time, your data will be far too big to make inputting it in R make any sense. Instead, you’ll have to import it from a file elsewhere on your computer - but we’ll get to that later. What’s very cool for our purposes is that R comes preloaded with a number of different datasets. Now, if you just type in the name of the dataset, you might overwhelm R for a moment - it will print out every single row of that dataset, no matter how long it is. Luckily for us, the head command lets us see just the first few rows of the data. If we use the dataset iris (included in base R), for instance, we’d get the following result: head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Note that while the default is to print six rows, you can choose how many rows to print by specifying n = ## in the head() function. You can even call the last few rows of your dataset by adding a negative sign - for instance: head(iris, n=-3) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 17 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 18 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 19 5.7 3.8 1.7 0.3 setosa ## 20 5.1 3.8 1.5 0.3 setosa ## 21 5.4 3.4 1.7 0.2 setosa ## 22 5.1 3.7 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 23 4.6 3.6 1.0 0.2 setosa ## 24 5.1 3.3 1.7 0.5 setosa ## 25 4.8 3.4 1.9 0.2 setosa ## 26 5.0 3.0 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 27 5.0 3.4 1.6 0.4 setosa ## 28 5.2 3.5 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 29 5.2 3.4 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 30 4.7 3.2 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 31 4.8 3.1 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 32 5.4 3.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 33 5.2 4.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 34 5.5 4.2 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 35 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 36 5.0 3.2 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 37 5.5 3.5 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 38 4.9 3.6 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 39 4.4 3.0 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 40 5.1 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 41 5.0 3.5 1.3 0.3 setosa ## 42 4.5 2.3 1.3 0.3 setosa ## 43 4.4 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 44 5.0 3.5 1.6 0.6 setosa ## 45 5.1 3.8 1.9 0.4 setosa ## 46 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 47 5.1 3.8 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 48 4.6 3.2 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 49 5.3 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 50 5.0 3.3 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 51 7.0 3.2 4.7 1.4 versicolor ## 52 6.4 3.2 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 53 6.9 3.1 4.9 1.5 versicolor ## 54 5.5 2.3 4.0 1.3 versicolor ## 55 6.5 2.8 4.6 1.5 versicolor ## 56 5.7 2.8 4.5 1.3 versicolor ## 57 6.3 3.3 4.7 1.6 versicolor ## 58 4.9 2.4 3.3 1.0 versicolor ## 59 6.6 2.9 4.6 1.3 versicolor ## 60 5.2 2.7 3.9 1.4 versicolor ## 61 5.0 2.0 3.5 1.0 versicolor ## 62 5.9 3.0 4.2 1.5 versicolor ## 63 6.0 2.2 4.0 1.0 versicolor ## 64 6.1 2.9 4.7 1.4 versicolor ## 65 5.6 2.9 3.6 1.3 versicolor ## 66 6.7 3.1 4.4 1.4 versicolor ## 67 5.6 3.0 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 68 5.8 2.7 4.1 1.0 versicolor ## 69 6.2 2.2 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 70 5.6 2.5 3.9 1.1 versicolor ## 71 5.9 3.2 4.8 1.8 versicolor ## 72 6.1 2.8 4.0 1.3 versicolor ## 73 6.3 2.5 4.9 1.5 versicolor ## 74 6.1 2.8 4.7 1.2 versicolor ## 75 6.4 2.9 4.3 1.3 versicolor ## 76 6.6 3.0 4.4 1.4 versicolor ## 77 6.8 2.8 4.8 1.4 versicolor ## 78 6.7 3.0 5.0 1.7 versicolor ## 79 6.0 2.9 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 80 5.7 2.6 3.5 1.0 versicolor ## 81 5.5 2.4 3.8 1.1 versicolor ## 82 5.5 2.4 3.7 1.0 versicolor ## 83 5.8 2.7 3.9 1.2 versicolor ## 84 6.0 2.7 5.1 1.6 versicolor ## 85 5.4 3.0 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 86 6.0 3.4 4.5 1.6 versicolor ## 87 6.7 3.1 4.7 1.5 versicolor ## 88 6.3 2.3 4.4 1.3 versicolor ## 89 5.6 3.0 4.1 1.3 versicolor ## 90 5.5 2.5 4.0 1.3 versicolor ## 91 5.5 2.6 4.4 1.2 versicolor ## 92 6.1 3.0 4.6 1.4 versicolor ## 93 5.8 2.6 4.0 1.2 versicolor ## 94 5.0 2.3 3.3 1.0 versicolor ## 95 5.6 2.7 4.2 1.3 versicolor ## 96 5.7 3.0 4.2 1.2 versicolor ## 97 5.7 2.9 4.2 1.3 versicolor ## 98 6.2 2.9 4.3 1.3 versicolor ## 99 5.1 2.5 3.0 1.1 versicolor ## 100 5.7 2.8 4.1 1.3 versicolor ## 101 6.3 3.3 6.0 2.5 virginica ## 102 5.8 2.7 5.1 1.9 virginica ## 103 7.1 3.0 5.9 2.1 virginica ## 104 6.3 2.9 5.6 1.8 virginica ## 105 6.5 3.0 5.8 2.2 virginica ## 106 7.6 3.0 6.6 2.1 virginica ## 107 4.9 2.5 4.5 1.7 virginica ## 108 7.3 2.9 6.3 1.8 virginica ## 109 6.7 2.5 5.8 1.8 virginica ## 110 7.2 3.6 6.1 2.5 virginica ## 111 6.5 3.2 5.1 2.0 virginica ## 112 6.4 2.7 5.3 1.9 virginica ## 113 6.8 3.0 5.5 2.1 virginica ## 114 5.7 2.5 5.0 2.0 virginica ## 115 5.8 2.8 5.1 2.4 virginica ## 116 6.4 3.2 5.3 2.3 virginica ## 117 6.5 3.0 5.5 1.8 virginica ## 118 7.7 3.8 6.7 2.2 virginica ## 119 7.7 2.6 6.9 2.3 virginica ## 120 6.0 2.2 5.0 1.5 virginica ## 121 6.9 3.2 5.7 2.3 virginica ## 122 5.6 2.8 4.9 2.0 virginica ## 123 7.7 2.8 6.7 2.0 virginica ## 124 6.3 2.7 4.9 1.8 virginica ## 125 6.7 3.3 5.7 2.1 virginica ## 126 7.2 3.2 6.0 1.8 virginica ## 127 6.2 2.8 4.8 1.8 virginica ## 128 6.1 3.0 4.9 1.8 virginica ## 129 6.4 2.8 5.6 2.1 virginica ## 130 7.2 3.0 5.8 1.6 virginica ## 131 7.4 2.8 6.1 1.9 virginica ## 132 7.9 3.8 6.4 2.0 virginica ## 133 6.4 2.8 5.6 2.2 virginica ## 134 6.3 2.8 5.1 1.5 virginica ## 135 6.1 2.6 5.6 1.4 virginica ## 136 7.7 3.0 6.1 2.3 virginica ## 137 6.3 3.4 5.6 2.4 virginica ## 138 6.4 3.1 5.5 1.8 virginica ## 139 6.0 3.0 4.8 1.8 virginica ## 140 6.9 3.1 5.4 2.1 virginica ## 141 6.7 3.1 5.6 2.4 virginica ## 142 6.9 3.1 5.1 2.3 virginica ## 143 5.8 2.7 5.1 1.9 virginica ## 144 6.8 3.2 5.9 2.3 virginica ## 145 6.7 3.3 5.7 2.5 virginica ## 146 6.7 3.0 5.2 2.3 virginica ## 147 6.3 2.5 5.0 1.9 virginica Pretty neat!
