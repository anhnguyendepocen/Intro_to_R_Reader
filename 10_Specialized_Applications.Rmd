## Even More Special Applications
The R community has built an incredible number of tools for all sorts of purposes, such as interactive apps, books, and full websites. R often isn't the best - or, at least, the most straightforward - tool to use to build these, but it does have a few advanges over traditional methods:

* The packages used in making these products usually have shortcuts built in to handle the most common use cases.
* Building these things with R allows you to embed R code in your app/book/website, letting your graphs and other outputs adapt to different web browsers/viewers better than an image file would - and letting you build interactive visualizations.
* You already know R, and while these may require some HTML code to become fully polished, you can do the majority of the work in a language you already speak.
