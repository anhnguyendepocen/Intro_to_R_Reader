This document contains course notes for a class I'm expecting to never be taught. Much of this course outline draws from Hadley Wickham's 2012 [stat405](http://stat405.had.co.nz/) class, as well as his wonderful textbooks [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (with Garrett Grolemund) and [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html). I've updated some elements, distilled others, and not kept much of the content, but the ideas and steering come very directly from those works.

Ignore this page for now - I haven't actually written it yet.
